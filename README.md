## Salutations 👋

I am known as JgbSpark7, or simply Ren to some. While I may not deem myself extraordinary, I find a certain quiet comfort in the shared journey we all walk, 
transient as it may be, through this brief and fragile mortal existence.


Fun fact abt me ina way - i got into computers because nintendo switch only had 30fps and bad ping issues
